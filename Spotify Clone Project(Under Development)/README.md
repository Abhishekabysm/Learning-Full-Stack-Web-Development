# Spotify Clone (Under Development)

This project is a Spotify clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to recreate the core features of Spotify's web interface, including a responsive layout, interactive music player, and dynamic content. This project is currently under development, with ongoing improvements and additional features being added.

## Features (Planned & Implemented)

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes for a seamless experience across devices.
- **Music Player Interface**: A functional player with play/pause, skip, and volume controls.
- **Dynamic Playlists**: Ability to view and interact with playlists (under development).
- **Interactive UI**: Hover effects, animations, and interactive elements to enhance the user experience.

## Demo

*(Note: This is a work in progress)*

## How It Works

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the app, including sections for the sidebar, main content area, and music player.
- **CSS**: Styles the app to mimic Spotifyâ€™s design, including colors, typography, and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity, including the music player controls and dynamic content loading (in progress).
