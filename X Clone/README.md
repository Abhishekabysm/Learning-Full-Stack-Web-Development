# Twitter Clone (Static) with Tailwind CSS

This project is a static clone of the Twitter homepage, built using only Tailwind CSS. It replicates the visual design of Twitter’s interface, focusing solely on layout and styling without any JavaScript functionality.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts to different screen sizes for an optimal experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Tailwind CSS Styling:** Utilizes Tailwind CSS for modern, utility-first styling, mimicking Twitter’s design.
- **Static Content:** Includes static HTML content to showcase the layout and design.

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhishekabysm/twitter-clone-tailwind.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd twitter-clone-tailwind
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have Node.js installed. Install the required Node modules by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Build and Serve the Project:**

   Use the following command to build the project and start a local server:

## How It Works

- **HTML**: Provides the basic structure of the Twitter clone, including the navigation bar, tweets feed, and profile sections.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styles the page using Tailwind’s utility classes for layout, spacing, colors, and typography.

## Files

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the Twitter clone.
- `style.css`: Includes the Tailwind CSS import and any additional custom styles.

## Customization

You can customize the clone by modifying `index.html` to adjust the layout and content, and by updating `style.css` to tweak styles or add custom Tailwind configurations.

## Limitations

- **No Interactivity:** This project does not include JavaScript, so features like tweets interaction, user login, and dynamic content are not functional.
- **Static Content:** All content is static and manually added, focusing on layout and design.
