- **Contact**: A contact page with a placeholder message.
- **User**: A user profile page that displays a username from the URL.

## Technologies Used

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhishekabysm/your-repo-name.git
