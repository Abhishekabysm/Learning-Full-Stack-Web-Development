# Hacker Simulator

This project simulates a "hacker" terminal experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The simulation features a command-line interface where users can type commands and see simulated "hacking" results, creating an immersive and fun experience.

## Features

- **Animated Text:** Typing animations and effects create a realistic terminal feel.
- **Responsive Design:** The interface adjusts to different screen sizes for an optimal experience on any device.

## Demo

## How It Works

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the terminal and command line interface.
- **CSS**: Styles the terminal, including the font, colors, and animations to mimic a real terminal environment.
- **JavaScript**: Handles user input, processes commands, and generates simulated outputs.

## Usage

To try out the Hacker Simulator, simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hacker-simulator.git
cd hacker-simulator
open index.html
```

## Files
